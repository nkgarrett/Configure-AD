This tutorial outlines the implementation of Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

* Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
* Remote Desktop<br>
* Active Directory Domain Services<br>
* PowerShell<br>

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

* Windows Server 2022<br>

* Join Client-1 to your domain<br>
* Setup Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1<br>
* Create additional users and log into client-1 with one of the users<br>
* Deployment and Configuration Steps
<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>
Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named 'DC-1'. Take note of the Resource Group ( which can be created on the VM creation page or from the Resource Group creation page ) and Virtual Network (Vnet) that get created here. Select a Region to place both your VMs and you'll want to select a size that has atleast 2 vcpus; anything less will cause the OS on your VM to run slowly. Once everything is filled out, review and create your VM.
